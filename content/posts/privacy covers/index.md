## This just bothers me beyond belief...
Right, so we all know how people on both Mac, Windows and even Linux use privacy covers for their laptops and desktop webcams? You know the things I'm talking about.

Why and when did these become a thing? Do you not trust your own device? Maybe instead of going out and purchasing one of these, take better care of your local security, and only visit websites that you know and trust!

## My main problem with these things is..
Why do you trust your phone more? Is it the convenience? Is it the fact it takes away from your spicy new iPhones aesthetic? Why do you trust your locked down phone, with much less control over what goes on, and who has access to the features the device has. It's a pretty terrible double standard if you ask me.

Trust me, I'm a guy who cares about security like anything else, I use Linux, I self host my own VPN and cloud storage, but I'll tell you right now, I don't use or care to use one of these. Why? Because I trust my computer. I know when it's being accessed and when it's not. I trust the sites I visit, and how I manage my data and devices.

## Where the problem came from?
I strongly believe that `Big Tech` has a lot to play in this matter. People *trust* companies and governments with their data and security and this just shouldn't be the case. I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist here, but I believe we should own and control our data, but big tech has taken over and removed so much control over everything from us, we've become lazy with these types of things, and that's exactly what these "privacy covers" are, a band aid on a bigger problem at hand.

## Conclusion from this rant
1. If you feel you don't trust your device enough to not have one of these or feel an urge to buy one, you're doing something wrong.
2. Take some time to gain some knowledge about technology, the services you use, and awesome alternatives.
3. Don't band aid every problem.
