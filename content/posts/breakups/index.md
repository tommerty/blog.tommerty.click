# Where do I even begin? 

A breakup is never going to be easy, no matter how long or short you're in it. Me for example, my relationship ended on March 6th, 2023 after 2049 days, or, about 6 and a half years.
From the ages of 19 until 26 I was in a relationship, and you do a lot of growing and learning in those years. I've had experiences I never thought I would, had a lot of fun, but somethings just eventually need to run their course. It wasn't easy, and I know as the "dumper" I'm not really owed much pity, but I also think that's not fair to say to myself either. When people ask me how am I, I instantly get defensive and state that "I done the breaking up, I don't get the pity". I was obviously hurting and wanted an out, does that mean I deserve pity because I hurt someone else in the process?

I've never been good at that kind of stuff, and just in general about speaking about my emotions. I tend to bottle up, brush things under the rug, and hope things will get better. But how can things get better if I don't speak up? How can I expect people to know I don't like something or I'm simply not happy, when I fail to express those emotions?

Over the past 2 months that's exactly what I did, I tried to talk about my emotions. It was fucking tough, it was a grind, and in the end I couldn't really verbalize it anyway. I don't like letting people down. There are very few people I full heartedly trust, but I don't even think I give them the full picture, either. That's something I'll want to work on in the future.

I'm obviously hurting, not being in my own house and back in my parents place until I can find somewhere else to call "home". Within a 4 hour period my life got flipped upside down. I was about to type "but that's my fault", which it is, but I guess I can be hurt, too. I need to come to terms with that.

## Moving Forward

Right now my main goal is to get back to Cork city. It's where my friends are at. It's where I can trust and open myself up to people. It's not what I thought it was for the past 5 years living there. I initially hated it, until I made friends about a year ago? And being able to message in a group chat saying "coffee?" knowing that the vast majority will be like "yup, where fam" is just something I need in my life right now. I think I can be hurtful to them sometimes, but I believe they understand my sense of humor and we have a laugh with it.

I don't think I'm going to get into a relationship anytime soon. I need time for me, to be myself, and experience what that's like. I've always lived with other people and been in relationships, and I feel like right now I just need to do that. Shit comes out of nowhere sometimes though, and I guess I'm open to that with time. We'll see where life takes us.

## My End Goal

Bruh, I just want to be happy. If that means being alone, or being anything else that I don't consider myself to be able to do or want to do currently, I'm open arms to it. I think I've always been a little unhappy, and I know I suffer from depression and insomnia from time to time (clinically tested, not just being an edge-lord here), and I guess I've never been in a position where it hasn't affected me in some way shape or form.

I think I know what I want, and I'm going to go get it, when the time is right.
