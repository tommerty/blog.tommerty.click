You know the things I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. picture of webcam privacy cover Why and when did these become a thing? Do you not trust your own device? Maybe instead of going out and purchasing one of these, take better care of your local security, and only visit websites that you know and trust!\nMy main problem with these things is.. Why do you trust your phone more? Is it the convenience? Is it the fact it takes away from your spicy new iPhones aesthetic? Why do you trust your locked down phone, with much less control over what goes on, and who has access to the features the device has. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty terrible double standard if you ask me.\nTrust me, I\u0026rsquo;m a guy who cares about security like anything else, I use Linux, I self host my own VPN and cloud storage, but I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t use or care to use one of these. Why? Because I trust my computer. I know when it\u0026rsquo;s being accessed and when it\u0026rsquo;s not. I trust the sites I visit, and how I manage my data and devices.\nWhere the problem came from? I strongly believe that Big Tech has a lot to play in this matter. People trust companies and governments with their data and security and this just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a conspiracy theorist here, but I believe we should own and control our data, but big tech has taken over and removed so much control over everything from us, we\u0026rsquo;ve become lazy with these types of things, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what these \u0026ldquo;privacy covers\u0026rdquo; are, a band aid on a bigger problem at hand.\nConclusion from this rant If you feel you don\u0026rsquo;t trust your device enough to not have one of these or feel an urge to buy one, you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong. Take some time to gain some knowledge about technology, the services you use, and awesome alternatives. Don\u0026rsquo;t band aid every problem.
