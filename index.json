[{"content":"Where do I even begin? A breakup is never going to be easy, no matter how long or short you\u0026rsquo;re in it. Me for example, my relationship ended on March 6th, 2023 after 2049 days, or, about 6 and a half years. From the ages of 19 until 26 I was in a relationship, and you do a lot of growing and learning in those years. I\u0026rsquo;ve had experiences I never thought I would, had a lot of fun, but somethings just eventually need to run their course. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy, and I know as the \u0026ldquo;dumper\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m not really owed much pity, but I also think that\u0026rsquo;s not fair to say to myself either. When people ask me how am I, I instantly get defensive and state that \u0026ldquo;I done the breaking up, I don\u0026rsquo;t get the pity\u0026rdquo;. I was obviously hurting and wanted an out, does that mean I deserve pity because I hurt someone else in the process?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never been good at that kind of stuff, and just in general about speaking about my emotions. I tend to bottle up, brush things under the rug, and hope things will get better. But how can things get better if I don\u0026rsquo;t speak up? How can I expect people to know I don\u0026rsquo;t like something or I\u0026rsquo;m simply not happy, when I fail to express those emotions?\nOver the past 2 months that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I did, I tried to talk about my emotions. It was fucking tough, it was a grind, and in the end I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really verbalize it anyway. I don\u0026rsquo;t like letting people down. There are very few people I full heartedly trust, but I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I give them the full picture, either. That\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ll want to work on in the future.\nI\u0026rsquo;m obviously hurting, not being in my own house and back in my parents place until I can find somewhere else to call \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo;. Within a 4 hour period my life got flipped upside down. I was about to type \u0026ldquo;but that\u0026rsquo;s my fault\u0026rdquo;, which it is, but I guess I can be hurt, too. I need to come to terms with that.\nMoving Forward Right now my main goal is to get back to Cork city. It\u0026rsquo;s where my friends are at. It\u0026rsquo;s where I can trust and open myself up to people. It\u0026rsquo;s not what I thought it was for the past 5 years living there. I initially hated it, until I made friends about a year ago? And being able to message in a group chat saying \u0026ldquo;coffee?\u0026rdquo; knowing that the vast majority will be like \u0026ldquo;yup, where fam\u0026rdquo; is just something I need in my life right now. I think I can be hurtful to them sometimes, but I believe they understand my sense of humor and we have a laugh with it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going to get into a relationship anytime soon. I need time for me, to be myself, and experience what that\u0026rsquo;s like. I\u0026rsquo;ve always lived with other people and been in relationships, and I feel like right now I just need to do that. Shit comes out of nowhere sometimes though, and I guess I\u0026rsquo;m open to that. There\u0026rsquo;s some shit I\u0026rsquo;m obviously not going to say in a random, public blog post. I know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about with this.\nMy End Goal Bruh, I just want to be happy. If that means being alone, or being anything else that I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself to be able to do or want to do currently, I\u0026rsquo;m open arms to it. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a little unhappy, and I know I suffer from depression and insomnia from time to time (clinically tested, not just being an edge-lord here), and I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve never been in a position where it hasn\u0026rsquo;t affected me in some way shape or form.\nI think I know what I want, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go get it, when the time is right.\n","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/posts/breakups/","section":"The Tommerty Blog","summary":"Where do I even begin?","title":"Breakup; What happens next..."},{"content":"","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"personal"},{"content":"","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/categories/personal/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/tags/relationships/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"relationships"},{"content":"","date":"March 8, 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"View my blogs below!

It takes Twitter but siphons out all the BS.Imagine a world where you can just join a social network without knowing the meta or anything like that. You follow what you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, and you only see that (and what those users boost).\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what Mastodon is, it\u0026rsquo;s basically that, but here\u0026rsquo;s the layman terms:\n\u0026ldquo;Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. It has microblogging features similar to Twitter, which are offered by a large number of independently run nodes, known as instances, each with its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy policy, privacy options, and content moderation policies.\u0026rdquo; - Thank you, Wikipedia!\nBut what about Discord? Where does that tie in? So if you aren\u0026rsquo;t aware, Discord is a messaging app basically, made up of \u0026ldquo;servers\u0026rdquo;, or just private DMs with friends. Inside these servers, admins add bots to their servers to give additional functionality, such as moderation, roles, announcements, etc. Gezel Bot has all that, and more. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to write this like an \u0026ldquo;advertisement\u0026rdquo; as I want it to be informative, but I do want to point out that I am the founder of Gezel and have written the frontend for Gezel Bot.\nWhy did we create this, you ask? It\u0026rsquo;s simple. So many Discord bots are paid, or lock a LOT of features behind a paywall. Basically my idea was \u0026ldquo;lets make the best Discord bot imaginable that\u0026rsquo;s free, and I\u0026rsquo;ll eat the server costs for as long as possible\u0026rdquo;. I know this won\u0026rsquo;t be sustainable, but I\u0026rsquo;m willing to host it for free as long as possible. When a time comes where the bot is making me bankrupt, we can look into ways to making some money to help pay for costs.\nSo where does Mastodon come on? Simple. You can find many Discord bots that offer ways to auto post Twitter feeds to Discord, but the same can\u0026rsquo;t be said for Mastodon sadly. So we began investigating.\nIt turns out that Mastodon uses RSS, so building this was quite simple. Basically when you add a URL to Gezel Bot we\u0026rsquo;ll automatically apply the .rss URL, and update your Discord with the information. If you add my account (https://mas.to/@tommerty/) we\u0026rsquo;ll basically apply the URL to be https://mas.to/@tommerty.rss. From that point, anything I post will be added to your Discord, in whatever room you\u0026rsquo;d like!\nThis also works the same for hashtags on the platform too, as they have the same .rss feature! This way you can have your Discord auto-populate with posts following specific topics, which may be very useful, depending on your use case!\nWant to see what it\u0026rsquo;s all about? Feel free to add Gezel Bot to your Discord server for free! ðŸ˜Š\n","date":"January 22, 2023","permalink":"/posts/gezel-bot/","section":"The Tommerty Blog","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s something special about Mastodon I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to put it, it\u0026rsquo;s just amazing.","title":"Integrating Mastodon with Discord"},{"content":"","date":"January 22, 2023","permalink":"/tags/mastodon/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mastodon"},{"content":"","date":"January 22, 2023","permalink":"/categories/mastodon/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Mastodon"},{"content":"","date":"January 22, 2023","permalink":"/tags/rss/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"RSS"},{"content":"","date":"January 3, 2023","permalink":"/tags/fediverse/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fediverse"},{"content":"Let get something out of the way first\u0026hellip; This was complicated. I was hoping for a easy-to-use Docker experience, and that\u0026rsquo;s not what I found. Even using something like CapRover I faced issues. Want to use something other than Ubuntu or Debian? Yeah\u0026hellip; Have fun. As someone who mainly uses Fedora Server, I had problem after problem getting it to work. I did eventually get it working, but it took about 5 hours of tinkering over multiple days with a friend who is better than I on Ubuntu to get up and going. But after all this, we finally got iCreate.Social off the ground!\nUpon migrating. Migrating was actually quite simple, a lot easier than I anticipated. I even made a simple step-by-step guide on the Gezel Wiki that I\u0026rsquo;ll outline here in case you\u0026rsquo;re curious:\n1. Create an account on iCreate.social 2. Head over and log into to your existing Mastodon account, and head over to `/settings/migration` and fill in your iCreate username and your password for your current instance. 3. Export any data you want from `/settings/export` in your current Mastodon server 4. Head over to https://icreate.social/settings/aliases and fill in your existing Mastodon server 5. Head over to https://icreate.social/settings/import and import your data that you exported. What it\u0026rsquo;s like running an instance. Quiet, very quiet. Unless you got a bunch of folk ready to join your instance, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be lonely. It was just me and Trent from Gezel, and it still currently is. I understand that with anything, getting users to your services is always the hardest part, and it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;ve promoted it a tonne, but it is still disheartening. But some people set up instances just for themselves, and that I\u0026rsquo;m perfectly ok with! But this instance in particular wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be that way, but I digress.\nYou actually get a lot of control with it, and can do loads of things and see a lot which is quite interesting! I was worried it was going to be a different dashboard to track everything but with most apps I use (Tusky and Fedilab) you can actually view everything from there which is really nice! A lot better than I expected.\nCustomizing This part was fun, especially as someone who classes themselves as a web developer. Here\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of iCreate: I had a lot of fun making CSS changes which is quite easy if you understand CSS. We styled this basically in tune with our other services like Gezel Bot and such.\nResponse We opted for very low caching rules to try help the server not end up with 0 storage, but what that does mean that if you\u0026rsquo;re loading the instance for the first time in a few hours, it\u0026rsquo;s slow, really slow. And I have this running on a 8 core, 16gb server with SSD storage. So there is a fine balance you need to find with that alright.\nGoing forward, will I keep it? Won\u0026rsquo;t lie, probably not. This was more of a test of \u0026lsquo;how easy is it\u0026rsquo; rather than a need. I miss the local tab on Fosstodon. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know, maybe if more people start using it I can justify the need. I\u0026rsquo;m not looking forward to when it comes time to update Mastodon, I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s going to break for some reason, so that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun..\nWhat are your thoughts on Mastodon?

You know the things I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. picture of webcam privacy cover Why and when did these become a thing? Do you not trust your own device? Maybe instead of going out and purchasing one of these, take better care of your local security, and only visit websites that you know and trust!\nMy main problem with these things is.. Why do you trust your phone more? Is it the convenience? Is it the fact it takes away from your spicy new iPhones aesthetic? Why do you trust your locked down phone, with much less control over what goes on, and who has access to the features the device has. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty terrible double standard if you ask me.\nTrust me, I\u0026rsquo;m a guy who cares about security like anything else, I use Linux, I self host my own VPN and cloud storage, but I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t use or care to use one of these. Why? Because I trust my computer. I know when it\u0026rsquo;s being accessed and when it\u0026rsquo;s not. I trust the sites I visit, and how I manage my data and devices.\nWhere the problem came from? I strongly believe that Big Tech has a lot to play in this matter. People trust companies and governments with their data and security and this just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a conspiracy theorist here, but I believe we should own and control our data, but big tech has taken over and removed so much control over everything from us, we\u0026rsquo;ve become lazy with these types of things, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what these \u0026ldquo;privacy covers\u0026rdquo; are, a band aid on a bigger problem at hand.\nConclusion from this rant If you feel you don\u0026rsquo;t trust your device enough to not have one of these or feel an urge to buy one, you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong. Take some time to gain some knowledge about technology, the services you use, and awesome alternatives. Don\u0026rsquo;t band aid every problem.
