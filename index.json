I was hoping for a easy-to-use Docker experience, and that\u0026rsquo;s not what I found. Even using something like CapRover I faced issues. Want to use something other than Ubuntu or Debian? Yeah\u0026hellip; Have fun. As someone who mainly uses Fedora Server, I had problem after problem getting it to work. I did eventually get it working, but it took about 5 hours of tinkering over multiple days with a friend who is better than I on Ubuntu to get up and going. But after all this, we finally got iCreate.Social off the ground!\nUpon migrating. Migrating was actually quite simple, a lot easier than I anticipated. I even made a simple step-by-step guide on the Gezel Wiki that I\u0026rsquo;ll outline here in case you\u0026rsquo;re curious:\n1. Create an account on iCreate.social 2. Head over and log into to your existing Mastodon account, and head over to `/settings/migration` and fill in your iCreate username and your password for your current instance. 3. Export any data you want from `/settings/export` in your current Mastodon server 4. Head over to https://icreate.social/settings/aliases and fill in your existing Mastodon server 5. Head over to https://icreate.social/settings/import and import your data that you exported. What it\u0026rsquo;s like running an instance. Quiet, very quiet. Unless you got a bunch of folk ready to join your instance, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be lonely. It was just me and Trent from Gezel, and it still currently is. I understand that with anything, getting users to your services is always the hardest part, and it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;ve promoted it a tonne, but it is still disheartening. But some people set up instances just for themselves, and that I\u0026rsquo;m perfectly ok with! But this instance in particular wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be that way, but I digress.\nYou actually get a lot of control with it, and can do loads of things and see a lot which is quite interesting! I was worried it was going to be a different dashboard to track everything but with most apps I use (Tusky and Fedilab) you can actually view everything from there which is really nice! A lot better than I expected.\nCustomizing This part was fun, especially as someone who classes themselves as a web developer. Here\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of iCreate: I had a lot of fun making CSS changes which is quite easy if you understand CSS. We styled this basically in tune with our other services like Gezel Bot and such.\nResponse We opted for very low caching rules to try help the server not end up with 0 storage, but what that does mean that if you\u0026rsquo;re loading the instance for the first time in a few hours, it\u0026rsquo;s slow, really slow. And I have this running on a 8 core, 16gb server with SSD storage. So there is a fine balance you need to find with that alright.\nGoing forward, will I keep it? Won\u0026rsquo;t lie, probably not. This was more of a test of \u0026lsquo;how easy is it\u0026rsquo; rather than a need. I miss the local tab on Fosstodon. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know, maybe if more people start using it I can justify the need. I\u0026rsquo;m not looking forward to when it comes time to update Mastodon, I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s going to break for some reason, so that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun..\nWhat are your thoughts on Mastodon?

You know the things I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. picture of webcam privacy cover Why and when did these become a thing? Do you not trust your own device? Maybe instead of going out and purchasing one of these, take better care of your local security, and only visit websites that you know and trust!\nMy main problem with these things is.. Why do you trust your phone more? Is it the convenience? Is it the fact it takes away from your spicy new iPhones aesthetic? Why do you trust your locked down phone, with much less control over what goes on, and who has access to the features the device has. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty terrible double standard if you ask me.\nTrust me, I\u0026rsquo;m a guy who cares about security like anything else, I use Linux, I self host my own VPN and cloud storage, but I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t use or care to use one of these. Why? Because I trust my computer. I know when it\u0026rsquo;s being accessed and when it\u0026rsquo;s not. I trust the sites I visit, and how I manage my data and devices.\nWhere the problem came from? I strongly believe that Big Tech has a lot to play in this matter. People trust companies and governments with their data and security and this just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a conspiracy theorist here, but I believe we should own and control our data, but big tech has taken over and removed so much control over everything from us, we\u0026rsquo;ve become lazy with these types of things, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what these \u0026ldquo;privacy covers\u0026rdquo; are, a band aid on a bigger problem at hand.\nConclusion from this rant If you feel you don\u0026rsquo;t trust your device enough to not have one of these or feel an urge to buy one, you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong. Take some time to gain some knowledge about technology, the services you use, and awesome alternatives. Don\u0026rsquo;t band aid every problem.
